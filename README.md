# ðŸš€ hypoport-stock

This is a little tool to analyse the Hypoport share for my application as a working student at Europace.

I received the Hypoport share price trend as a hypoport.json file.

I would like to determine the following values:
- day with the lowest price
- day with the highest price
- day with the biggest difference between the opening and closing price
- the average closing price

The respective days of the share prices are displayed as Epoch / Unix timestamps.
The Unix epoch is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC time minus the leap seconds.
You can find the current Epoch / Unix timestamp here:

### ðŸ‘‰ You can find my results within "outcome.txt"
